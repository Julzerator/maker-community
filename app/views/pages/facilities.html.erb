            <p>Maker Community is a shared workshop space at <a class="link-in-text" href="https://goo.gl/maps/yS66KdMw8Avp1m4A8">70 Saxon St Brunswick</a>, in Melbourne (Australia).</p>
            <p>
              If you've been to a Maker Space, or a Men's Shed, you probably get the idea. Our workshop is open to everyone, and is a great place to work on your own projects and take part of group
              builds and activities.

          <p>
            üßë‚Äçü¶Ω <strong>Wheelchair access</strong><br />
            Wheelchair access to this venue is poor. Entry requires the large door be open, which should be the case during open times. From there the main benches and machine shop are accessible.
            Textiles and electronics are upstairs and not accessible. Toilets are located on the ground floor but the corridor is only 1m wide.
          </p>
          <p>
            üîäüí° <strong>Sensory enviroment</strong><br />
            The workshop is predominantly lit with overhead fluerescent lights. The welding area is shielded to prevent visability of sparks. Machine sounds are frequent and loud, hearing protection
            is recommended in the machine shop area in particular. We are experimenting with a Quiet Night every second week.
